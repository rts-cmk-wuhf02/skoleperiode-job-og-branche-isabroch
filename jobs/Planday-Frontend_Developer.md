**About Planday**

We want to improve the lives of more than 1 billion shift workers across the globe with a workforce management platform which enables both employee managers and their employees to work together easily, with greater transparency and more open communication. By digitising and automating administrative tasks and integrating multiple business and people-focussed systems in one place, we believe we can help everyone save time and money so they can focus instead on the things that really matter.

Founded in a Copenhagen bar in 2004 by two hospitality workers who wanted to make shift rostering easier, Planday is one of the fastest growing VC-backed technology companies in Europe. In the last year alone, we have almost doubled our number of employees throughout the world and we want to continue to expand. Our latest series C funding round was backed by some of the biggest VCs in Europe, including Creandum, IdInvest and SEB Equity -- the investors behind Spotify and iZettle.

Our roots are Danish, but our mindset and know-how is global. Planday's team spans 30 nationalities across five offices -- Copenhagen, London, Oslo, Hamburg and LA. We live and breathe for our customers' success, while retaining a Scandinavian approach to work-life balance. We celebrate each other's achievements and differences while encouraging each other to learn and grow together. This is how we became the leading workforce scheduling platform used by SME and enterprise businesses globally.
